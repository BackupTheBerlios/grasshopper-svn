This directory contains some code to demonstrate how to use the GPIO-Pins, the
LEDs and the USARTs of the ICnova.

The code can freely be used in other projects of our customers.

The easiest way to use the code is to use the interface described in the
Header-files led.h, gpio.h and uart.h. The only thing you have to do is linking
your program against libicnova. This is done by passing -licnova to the linker.
An example of how this is done, can be seen in icnova-demo.c.

The other way is to do all the work by hand. Most of it is some work with
different files. Even if it looks unused to some users, all the files used
are exported by the kernel in some virtual file-systems. So those files doesn't
exist in real somewhere on your disk, but are created and removed on the fly
by the linux kernel and are used to control the behaviour of the drivers.
The implementation of this can be seen in the files led.c, gpio.c and uart.c.

To compile your program afterwards, you just need to use the toolchain for the
avr32. If you don't use our buildroot and want to use the library, you have to 
make sure, that the compile finds that as well as the header-files.
The header-files can be found in this directory, the library on the icnova.
